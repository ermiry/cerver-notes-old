Communications Protocols
Sending a message, whether by face-to-face communication or over a network, is governed by rules
called protocols. These protocols are specific to the type of communication method being used. Prior to
communicating, the devices must agree on how to communicate. They must also format the message in a
way that is understandable. Protocols must account for the following requirements to successfully deliver
a message that is understood by the receiver:
– An identified sender and receiver
– Common language and grammar
– Speed and timing of delivery
– Confirmation or acknowledgment requirements
The protocols that are used in network communications share many of these fundamental traits. In
addition to identifying the source and destination, computer and network protocols define the details of
how a message is transmitted across a network. Common computer protocols include the following
requirements:
Message encoding Encoding is the process of converting information into another acceptable form, for
transmission. Decoding reverses this process to interpret the information. Encoding between hosts must
be in an appropriate format for the medium. Messages sent across the network are first converted into
bits by the sending host. Each bit is encoded into a pattern of voltages on copper wires, infrared light in
optical fibers, or microwaves for wireless systems. The destination host receives and decodes the signals
to interpret the message.
Message formatting and encapsulation When a message is sent from source to destination, it must
use a specific format or structure. Message formats depend on the type of message and the channel that
is used to deliver the message. The formatting process is concerned with properly identifying the
address of the sender and receiver.
Message size When a long message is sent from one host to another over a network, it is necessary to
break the message into smaller pieces. The rules that govern the size of the pieces, or frames,
communicated across the network are very strict. They can also be different, depending on the channel
used. Frames that are too long or too short are not delivered. The size restrictions of frames require the
source host to break a long message into individual pieces that meet both the minimum and maximum
size requirements. The long message will be sent in separate frames, with each frame containing a piece
of the original message. Each frame will also have its own addressing information. At the receiving host,
the individual pieces of the message are reconstructed into the original message.
Message timing
– Flow Control This is the process of managing the rate of data transmission. Flow control defines
how much information can be sent and the speed at which it can be delivered. For example, if
one person speaks too quickly, it may be difficult for the receiver to hear and understand the
message. In network communication, there are network protocols used by the source and
destination devices to negotiate and manage the flow of information.
– Response Timeout If a person asks a question and does not hear a response within an
acceptable amount of time, the person assumes that no answer is coming and reacts accordingly.
The person may repeat the question or instead, may go on with the conversation. Hosts on the
network use network protocols that specify how long to wait for responses and what action to take
if a response timeout occurs.
– Access method This determines when someone can send a message. When a device wants to
transmit on a wireless LAN, it is necessary for the WLAN network interface card (NIC) to
determine whether the wireless medium is available.
Message delivery options A message can be delivered in different ways.
– Unicast Information is being transmitted to a single end device.
– Multicast Information is being transmitted to a one or more end devices.
– Broadcast Information is being transmitted to all end devices.
Network Protocols
Network protocols define a common format and set of rules for exchanging messages between devices.
Protocols are implemented by end devices and intermediary devices in software, hardware, or both. Each
network protocol has its own function, format, and rules for communications.
Network Communications Protocols Protocols enable two or more devices to communicate over one
or more networks. The Ethernet family of technologies involves a variety of protocols such as IP,
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and many more.
Network Security Protocols Protocols secure data to provide authentication, data integrity, and data
encryption. Examples of secure protocols include Secure Shell (SSH), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and
Transport Layer Security (TLS).
Routing Protocols Protocols enable routers to exchange route information, compare path information,
and then to select the best path to the destination network. Examples of routing protocols include Open
Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
Service Discovery Protocols Protocols are used for the automatic detection of devices or services.
Examples of service discovery protocols include Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) which
discovers services for IP address allocation, and Domain Name System (DNS) which is used to perform
name-to-IP address translation.

Network Protocols Functions
Addressing This identifies the sender and the intended receiver of the message using a defined
addressing scheme. Examples of protocols that provide addressing include Ethernet, IPv4, and IPv6.
Reliability This function provides guaranteed delivery mechanisms in case messages are lost or
corrupted in transit. TCP provides guaranteed delivery.
Flow control This function ensures that data flows at an efficient rate between two communicating
devices. TCP provides flow control services.
Sequencing This function uniquely labels each transmitted segment of data. The receiving device uses
the sequencing information to reassemble the information correctly. This is useful if the data segments
are lost, delayed or received out-of-order. TCP provides sequencing services.
Error Detection This function is used to determine if data became corrupted during transmission. Various
protocols that provide error detection include Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, and TCP.
Application Interface This function contains information used for process-to-process communications
between network applications. For example, when accessing a web page, HTTP or HTTPS protocols are
used to communicate between the client and server web processes.

TCP/IP Protocol Suite
TCP/IP protocols are available for the application, transport, and internet layers. There are no TCP/IP
protocols in the network access layer. The most common network access layer LAN protocols are
Ethernet and WLAN (wireless LAN) protocols. Network access layer protocols are responsible for
delivering the IP packet over the physical medium.
Open standard protocol suite This means it is freely available to the public and can be used by any
vendor on their hardware or in their software.
Standards-based protocol suite This means it has been endorsed by the networking industry and
approved by a standards organization. This ensures that products from different manufacturers can
interoperate successfully.
